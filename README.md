# Diabetes-Prediction-System

This project predicts **whether a person has diabetes** based on medical features like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. 
It uses **Machine Learning (ML) models** to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Uses **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib**.
- Loads a **diabetes dataset** for training and testing.
- Implements **ML models** like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Evaluates models using **accuracy, precision, and recall**.
- Predicts whether a person **has diabetes or not**.
- Provides a **user-friendly interface** for prediction.
